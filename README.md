# rf_bench_automation
I have 3 python files for this project. One is an instrument driver using SCPI commands to programmatically control functions of a spectrum analyzer, signal generator, and power supply. Some of the functions range from commanding power, setting voltage, loading ARB waveforms, setting up EVM, and Channel Power. The second python file is used to parse a .csv file containing path losses for a 2 to 4 port splitter (from ESG + EXA >> thru splitter >> to 4 port connections on DUT). This file is used to gather the Frequeny vs. Path Loss (dB) data so it can then be loaded to the EXA and ESG for accurate power measurement.

The 3rd (serial_command.py) is the most important because it uses a DLL file written in C. I used python ctypes library to call the DLL, declare variable types for each function, and then send parameters to the functions and read back the returned values. These are macros that are used to get temperature readings, get DSSI, get Software Version Types, Frequency values, and also Set frequencies, power levels, and binary waveform files for IQ streaming. These macros digital setup the DUT and is necessary to enable the device for each test...not just setting up the instruments.
